    *******************
    command: less - view a files content in a searchable and paginated way
    example: less /etc/passwd - paginate the file /etc/passwd

    q - quit
    G - go to bottom of page
    g - go to top of page
    /text - search for specific text
    n - repeat the last search
    ?text - perform backwards search for specific text
    
     *******************
     command: cat - view a files contents
     example: cat /etc/passwd - displays the contents of /etc/passwd to STDOUT
     
     File Descriptors: https://www.bottomupcs.com/file_descriptors.xhtml
     STDIN =  0
     STDOUT = 1
     STDERR = 2

    better used for short files as it ends on the last line of output, 
    if you want to display the first line of output in a long file try 
    using 'tac' the inverse of cat
    
    example: tac /etc/passwd
    
    *******************
    command: tail - displays the last x number of lines of a file
    example: tail /etc/passwd - displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd

    -n 5 or 5 - will display the last 5 lines
    -f will display last 10 lines and continue to refresh output (great for watching log files)
    
    *******************
    command: head - displays the first x number of lines of a file
    example: head /etc/passwd - displays the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd

    -n 5 or 5 - will display the first 5 lines

    example: head -n 11 /etc/passwd | tail -n 1 - displays line number 11 in /etc/passwd
    
    *******************
    command: cut - retrieve specific information from a file based off of a delimeter
    example: cut -d ':' -f 1 /etc/passwd - will display the text in the first column of 
             /etc/passwd using the ':' as the marker for the next column or delimiter

    
    *******************
    command: sort - sorts the data sent to STDOUT
    example: sort /etc/passwd - sorts the content of /etc/passwd in alphabetic order

    -n - sort in numeric order
    -r - sort in reverse order (-rn)
    -k - sort by column number (-k3)
    -t - use a delimiter (-t ':')

    example: sort -n -k3 -t ':' /etc/passwd - sort on column 3 of /etc/passwd using ':' as the delimiter
    
    *******************
    command: wc - displays the number of lines, words, and chars in a file
    example: wc /etc/passwd - displays the number of lines, words, and characters in /etc/passwd

    -l - number of lines
    -w - number of words
    -c - number of characters
    -L - length of longest line
    
    *******************
    command: grep - search for a particular pattern within a file
    example: grep ^jeep /Documents/vehicles.txt - uses a regular expression to search for all lines that start with the string jeep in the file /Documents/vehicles.txt

    ^text - line starts with text
    text$ - line ends with text
    . - wildcard that matches any single character
    [abc] - matches a, b, or c
    * - match 0 to infinite number of the previous character
    {2} - match exactly two of the previous character
    {1,3} - match a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 3 of the previous character
    colou?r - match 0 or 1 of the previous character, makes the previous character optional
    -i - not case sensitive
    -v - show lines that do not contain the expression
    -r - search files in the current director and all subdirectories
    -e - used for matching more than one expression on a line
    -A <number> - display <number> of lines after the matching regular expression
    -B <number> - display <number> of lines before the matching regular expression

    example: grep '^#' /file - will display all the lines starting with a # (i.e. comments)
    example: grep -v '^#' /file - display all lines that do not start with a #
    example: grep -v '^#' /file -B 5 - show lines that do not start with a # and the five lines before it
    example: grep -v -e '^#' -e '^$' /file - exclude all lines that are blank or start with a #
